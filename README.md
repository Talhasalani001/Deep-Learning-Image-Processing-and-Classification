## Project Overview

This project is part of the **CS/CE 457/464 Homework Assignment 11** and involves the following tasks:

1. **Image Filtering:**
   - Apply three different filters to a chosen image.
   - Display the filtered images and explain the purpose and outcome of each filter.
   - Analyze whether the filter outputs match their intended purpose.

2. **Deep Learning Classifier:**
   - Train a deep learning classifier on a dataset containing images of two object classes (e.g., animals, letters, or monuments).  
   - Use 50 images for training and 15 images for testing for each class.
   - Report training and validation/testing accuracy across epochs.
   - Test the classifier on 6 unseen images (3 per class) and evaluate its performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Libraries:**
  - `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` (for deep learning models)
  - `OpenCV` (for image filtering and processing)
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` (for visualizations)
  - `NumPy` and `Pandas` (for data handling)
  - `scikit-image` (for image processing)

## Tasks and Deliverables

### Task 1: Image Filtering
- Select any image of your choice.
- Apply three filters (e.g., Gaussian blur, edge detection, sharpening) and display the output for each filter.
- Describe the purpose of each filter and evaluate if the output matches expectations.

### Task 2: Deep Learning Classifier
- Select a dataset containing two object classes (e.g., animals, letters, monuments, or currency bills).
- Train a classifier using a deep learning model (e.g., CNN).
- Report the best training and validation/testing accuracy across epochs.
- Test the classifier on 6 new images (3 per class) that were not part of the training or testing sets.
- Evaluate the performance of the classifier on the unseen images.
