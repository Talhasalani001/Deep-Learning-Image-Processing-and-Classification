# Deep-Learning-Image-Processing-and-Classification
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for image data. It includes image filtering with three different filters, along with training and testing a deep learning classifier on a dataset of two object classes. Results include accuracy metrics, visualizations, and classifier performance on unseen images.
